From the Albums:
* Bloody buccaneers
* The naked truth

I wanna talk to you,
Please let me talk to you
But you don't let me in
I wanna hold you
But I don't know where to begin
One shot away from paradise
I'll be there to open your eyes
You're hidin' - hidin' in your head
Layin' on your bed
You're zoning away, got nothing to say
You're hiding, you lock yourself away
Day after day
But don't you know I'm with you
It's hard to be with you
Lemme tell ya
One shot away from paradise
I'll be there to open your eyes
You're smilin', baby you're smilin'
That's when I know you're coming home
That's when I feel I'm not alone
No no
You're crying, sometimes you're crying
That's when I know we're still alive
That's when I feel we will survive
'Cause baby don't you know that
I'll be there to open your eyes
I'll be there when you open your eyes
We're just one shot away from paradise
I'll be waiting with my arms open wide
