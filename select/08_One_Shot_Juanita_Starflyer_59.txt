Times only wasted
When you know
Like I know
The past times
Weren't the better times
At all

Stop stabbing my heart
Stop stabbing my heart
Stop stabbing my heart
Stop stabbing my heart

She's coming right here
From the start
I know
Your past life
The better wife
Your own
I know

Stop stabbing my heart
Stop stabbing my heart
Stop stabbing my heart
Stop stabbing my heart

(I wrote this letter
Just to say
I love you
I wrote that
Just to say
I love you
Juanita)
