Ooo-oo-oo-oh, oo-oo-oo-oh
Ooo-oo-oo-oh, oo-oo-ooo

The last days were the meanest
Leanest days of our lives
You threw me the pieces
I started the fire
One thing led to a dead end
One shot put her away, hey-hey

Look out on a green world
Windows and wives
No bedroom to run to
No miracle jive - no conversation

Then nothing meant nothing
Ten dollars tore us apart
One thing led to a dead end
One shot put her away

One day nothing meant nothing
Ten dollars tore us apart
One thing led to a dead end
One shot put her away

The last days were the meanest
Leanest days of our lives
One thing led to a dead end
One shot further away

Looked out on a green world
Windows and wives
No bedroom to run to
No miracle jive - no conversation

Hot love is the dearest
No money can buy
She burnt like a spitfire
One shot put her away

One shot put her away, heh-heh
One shot put her away, uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh
Oo-oo-oo-oh, uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh
Oo-oo-oo-oh, uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh
Oo-oo-oo-oh, uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh
Oo-oo-oo-oh, uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh
Oo-oo-oo-oh, uh-huh-huh
One shot put her away
